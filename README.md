# Basic 2D Game
This is a very basic 2D videogame made with Unity. This mini-project was originally made as a commission on November 29th, 2017 (Link to the folder in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qKR3oUkydhOfZhoNDpVVNRZUWrBjaR-L?usp=sharing), but I have decided to do some little improvements, and then to upload it to this repository until now (April 20th, 2024).
